# CSCI4560_GradeBookProject

This project is meant to be used by teachers and students to add and view grades respectively. ​
As such, teachers/students would have separate logins, with different views. ​
For example, teachers would be able to select from their class/section to add grades or ​analyze class data. 
Students would be able select from their class, view class statistics, or view their own individual grades.

At minimun, this would likely require Student, Teacher, Class, Section, and Grade tables with unique attributes.
